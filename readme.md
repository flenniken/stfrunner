# stfrunner

stfrunner is a standalone command to run Single Test File (stf) files.

You use runner for testing command line applications. A stf file
contains the test which the runner executes to determine whether the
test passed.

A stf file contains instructions for creating files, running files and
comparing files and it is designed to look good in a markdown reader.

See the runner help message for more information about stf files.
